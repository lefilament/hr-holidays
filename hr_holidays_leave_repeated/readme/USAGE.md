1.  Create a leave request, selecting the leave type having flag Repeat
    set to True.
2.  Set the 'Repeat Mode' field to 'Number of Times'. Set the proper
    values for 'Repeat Every' and 'Repeat \# times'.
3.  Alternatively set the 'Repeat Mode' field to 'End Date', then set
    'Repeat Every' and 'Repeat End Date'.
4.  Create (save) the leave request. All the periodical leave requests
    are automatically created.

Note for HR Time Off responsibles : creating repeated leaves can only
be used when selecting Mode = "By Employee" and that all selected
employees should share the same resource calendar, otherwise an error
is raised.
